# Description
This project is the product of combining the skills we have learned in the first trimester of our software engineering bootcamp. In addition to that an emphasis was placed on self reliance as well as using available reputable documentation for learning new skills. I have created a simple game of memory. Click on cards to find matches!

# Gameplay looks like this!

You will be clicking on cards to flip them over. The goal is to try and uncover matching pairs.
